                <h2>Shikaarii</h2>
                <P><b>The parachute units of the Indian Army are among the oldest airborne units in the world. The 50th
                        Indian Parachute Brigade was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British 151st Parachute
                        Battalion, the British Indian Army 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha
                        Parachute Battalion.[3][7] The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units
                        in 1952.</b>

                    In 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded 44th Airborne Division. In the
                    post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigadeâ€”the 50th. This brigade
                    consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief,
                    namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the Jammu and Kashmir
                    operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of
                    Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch, and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.

                    On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their
                    respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has
                    grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA
                    became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special
                    Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had
                    extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of
                    professionalism.

                    During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, an ad hoc commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of
                    volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the Brigade of the
                    Guards. The unit performed exceptionally well during the war destroying many strategic bridges and
                    killing many Pakistani soldiers, and thus the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando
                    unit. Lt Col Megh Singh was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of
                    the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of
                    special operations, the unit was transferred to the Parachute Regiment and raised as its 9th
                    Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus,
                    and the new unit was based in Gwalior. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a
                    second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies. 10th Battalion was
                    mandated to operate in the Western Desert and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969,
                    these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.[3][8]

                    In 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the
                    Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff
                    Unit Citation twice, and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1
                    Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (Punjab) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF).

                    On 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO (OR), and
                    the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and
                    Training Centre. Bangalore is the new Key Location Project of the centre.[9]

                    1995 saw the formation of the fourth commando battalion when 21 Maratha Light Infantry was selected
                    to convert to special forces and slated for the Eastern Command. After a stringent selection and
                    training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB
                    Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The
                    unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit
                    Citation thrice (1992, 2006 and 2011) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation twice (2008 and
                    2016), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. Most notable operations being in the Loktak
                    Lake of Manipur. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special
                    forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed
                    closely by the 3rd Para and the 4th Para in the year 2004 and 2005. Further 11th Para (SF) in 2011,
                    12th Para (SF) in 2013 and 13th Para (SF) in 2022 were raised from within the strength of the
                    regiment to augment the strength of the existing Special Forces battalions. In 2022, 5th Para, 6th
                    Para, 7th Para, 23rd Para and 29th Para were converted to a specialist role having improved their
                    skills over two months of training that culminated in a graduation celebration over seven days and a
                    significant boost to operational capability.[10][11]
